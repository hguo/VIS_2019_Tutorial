\section*{ABSTRACT}
Efficient analysis and visualization of data using statistical methods is a popular pathway in the visualization community. As the size of data is growing rapidly, researchers have adopted for techniques of data exploration which are primarily driven by efficient identification and analysis of important regions (generally termed as features), instead of looking at the data at its entirety. Use of probability distributions in this context is found to be attractive by many researchers. Distributions computed from data samples are capable of compactly representing the statistical characteristics of features, which can be efficiently analyzed and visualized. Recent developments in the visualization domain have demonstrated the applicability of distribution-based data visualization methods by introducing novel stochastic algorithms and addressing problems such as: feature identification, extraction, and tracking; multi-variable relationship exploration; query-driven visualization; integral curve-based flow feature analysis; and many more.

As we step into the era of big data, relevance of distribution-based methods has become even more prominent. Since, the I/O speed can not keep up with the computation speed, storage of extreme-scale raw data, generated by high-resolution simulations is facing a critical bottleneck. Therefore, data analysts are favoring alternative methods leading to summarization of large data in a reduced and compact format, while preserving as much information as possible. Researchers have shown that, by transforming the data into a distribution-based representation, significant data reduction is possible. Furthermore, this reduced data can be used as a replacement of the raw data enabling flexible exploration with the much needed capability of uncertainty quantification during visualization. A wide range of visualization applications using distribution-based data have been developed already which evidently indicate that, distribution-based methods will provide a promising path-forward for the future data visualization researches.

Given the promising aspects of distribution-based methods in visual analysis, we would like to organize a tutorial on the topic of \textit{distribution-based visualization methods}. The tutorial will highlight concepts regarding distribution-based data modeling appropriate for a variety of applications. A comprehensive discussion on many state-of-the-art visualization methods that uses distribution data will be carried out which will serve as a ground work for the audience who are interested in conducting research in this avenue. We will systematically introduce different categories of visual-analytics tasks that have utilized and benefited from distributions. Finally, latest research trends adopting \textit{in situ} distribution-guided data summarization enabling scalable and flexible post-analysis based visualization techniques will be discussed. We will conclude our session by highlighting several future scopes and open problems in this area needed to be solved for the further advancements of distribution-based methods in visualization.

Soumya Dutta is currently a postdoctoral research associate in Data Science at Scale team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He received his MS and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Ohio State University in May 2017 and May 2018 respectively with a focus in Computer Graphics and Visualization. His major research interests are statistical data summarization and analysis; in situ data analysis, reduction, and feature exploration; uncertainty analysis; and time-varying, multivariate data exploration. He received an honorable mention award at IEEE Visualization (SciVis track) 2016 and was nominated for the Presidential Fellowship from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University in 2017. He won best poster award in the Annual CSE Student Research Poster Exhibition at the Ohio State University in 2017 and 2018. He is also serving as a co-chair for Open Practices in IEEE Visualization (SciVis) 2019.
